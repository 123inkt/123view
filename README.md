# 123view - code review and commit notifications
A symfony application to create code reviews for a specific set of revisions not tied to a branch and to allow receiving commit notification for all commits in a certain time period.

### Features

**Code review:**
- Code reviews per repository.
- Join review, place comment or react to comment, accept and reject reviews.
- Attach and detach revisions to and from a review.
- Webhook to allow external projects be notified about review changes.

**Commit notification:**
- Receive one mail for all commits within a certain time period. Once per one, two, three, fours hours or daily or weekly.
- Exclude (or include) certain commit messages, files, or authors.
- Receive commits in a single mail for multiple repositories.
- Light or dark theme notification mail.
- Add links to your task or jira board based on the commit message.

**Examples:**
- Watch changes for `composer.json` for one or more repositories.
- Exclude all commits done by ci- or other automated processes.
- Exclude changes done to `composer.lock` for a repository.
